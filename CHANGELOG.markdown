5.6.1 [????.??.??]
-----------------
* Add `Functor` instances for `PastroSum`, `CopastroSum`, `Environment`,
  `FreeMapping`, `Pastro`, `Copastro`, `FreeTraversing`, and `Coyoneda`.
* Explicitly mark modules as `Safe`.

5.6 [2020.10.01]
----------------
* Enable the `PolyKinds` extension. The following datatypes now have
  polymorphic kinds: `(:->)`, `Cayley`, `Procompose`, `Rift`,
  `ProfunctorFunctor`, `Ran`, `Codensity`, `Prep`, `Coprep`, `Star`, `Costar`,
  `WrappedArrow`, `Forget`.
* Allow building with GHC 9.0.

5.5.2 [2020.02.13]
------------------
* Add `Cochoice`, `Costrong`, `Closed`, `Traversing`, and `Mapping` instances
  for `Cayley`.
* Add `Mapping` and `Traversing` instances for `Tannen`.

5.5.1 [2019.11.26]
------------------
* Add `Choice`, `Cochoice`, `Closed`, `Strong`, and `Costrong` instances for
  `Data.Bifunctor.Sum`.

5.5 [2019.09.06]
----------------
* Change the type of `roam` to make it actually useful.
* Add a `Cochoice` instance for `Forget`.

5.4 [2019.05.10]
----------------
* Add `wander`-like combinator `roam` to `Mapping`.
* Remove illegal `instance Choice (Costar w)`.
* Add `strong` combinator #62.
* Only depend on `semigroups` before GHC 8.0.
* Add `Contravariant` instances for `Star` and `Forget`.

5.3 [2018.07.02]
----------------
* Generalize the types of `(#.)` and `(.#)`. Before, they were:

  ```haskell
  (#.) :: (Profunctor p, Coercible c b) => (b -> c) -> p a b    -> p a c
  (.#) :: (Profunctor p, Coercible b a) => p b c    -> (a -> b) -> p a c
  ```

  Now, they are:

  ```haskell
  (#.) :: (Profunctor p, Coercible c b) => q b c    -> p a b    -> p a c
  (.#) :: (Profunctor p, Coercible b a) => p b c    -> q a b    -> p a c
  ```
* Drop support for GHC < 7.8.
* Add a `Profunctor` instance for `Data.Bifunctor.Sum`.

5.2.2 [2018.01.18]
------------------
* Add `Semigroup` instances for `Closure` and `Tambara`

5.2.1
-----
* Allow `base-orphans-0.6`.
* Add `Traversing` instance for `Forget`
* Add `Traversing` and `Mapping` instances for `Procompose`
* Add `Category` instance for `Star`
* Add `mapCayley` to `Data.Profunctor.Cayley`
* Add `pastro` and `unpastro` to `Data.Profunctor.Strong`.
* Add `dimapWandering`, `lmapWandering`, and `rmapWandering` to `Data.Profunctor.Traversing`
* Add documentation stating the laws for various profunctors.
* Introduce the `Data.Profunctor.Yoneda` module.

5.2
---
* Renamed `Cotambara` to `TambaraChoice` and `Pastro` to `PastroChoice`.
* Added a true `Cotambara` and `Copastro` construction for (co)freely generating costrength, along with `CotambaraSum` and `CopastroSum` variants.
* Engaged in a fair bit of bikeshedding about the module structure for lesser used modules in this package.

5.1.2
-----
* Added `Prep` and `Coprep` along with witnesses to the adjunctions `Prep -| Star : [Hask,Hask] -> Prof` and `Coprep -| Costar : [Hask,Hask]^op -> Prof`.

5.1.1
-----
* Add proper support for GHC 7.0+.

5.1
---
* `instance Costrong (Cokleisli f)`.
* `instance Cochoice (Star f)`.
* Changed the instance for `Cochoice (Costar f)`.

5.0.1
-----
* MINIMAL pragma for `Costrong` and `Cochoice`.
* More `Costrong` and `Cochoice` instances.

5.0.0.1
-------
* Documentation fix

5
-
* `UpStar` and `DownStar` have become `Star` and `Costar`. `Star` is analogous to `Kleisli`, `Costar` is analogous to `Cokleisli`.
* Split representability into sieves and representability.
* Moved `Data.Profunctor.Collage` to `semigroupoids` 5, and removed the `semigroupoids` dependency.
* Rather greatly widened the range of GHC versions we can support.

4.4.1
-------
* Using `SafeHaskell`, GHC 7.8+ `Data.Profunctor.Unsafe` now infers as `Trustworthy` and
  many more modules now infer as `Safe`.
* We now build warning-free on GHC 7.10.0.20150307

4.4
-----
* Added `Coercible` constraint to (#.) and (.#) when building with GHC 7.8
* `Strong` is now a superclass of `Representable`
* Updated the URL of the "Arrows are Strong Monads" paper. The old URL is now a dead link.

4.3.2
-----
* Added some missing instances for `UpStar` and `DownStar`.

4.3
---
* Removed the non law-abiding instance for `Closed (Forget r)`
* `Forget` is `Representable`
* MINIMAL pragmas

4.2.0.1
-------
* Avoided using 'type' in the export list, as that doesn't work on 7.4.

4.2
---
* Renamed `-|` to `ProfunctorAdjunction` because GHC 7.4 still exists in the wild.
* Renamed `-/->` to `:->` for the same reason. Also the former was confusing as they conflated profunctor homomorphisms and profunctors themselves.

4.1
---
* Flipped the order of 'Procompose'
* Added the notion of Monads and Comonads on the category of profunctors.
* Added 'Cayley' which takes normal Haskell Monads and Comonads to a 'ProfunctorMonad' and 'ProfunctorComonad' respectively. Cayley is also known as the 'static arrow' construction
* Added 'Closed' which is adjoint to 'Strong'.
* Added 'Closure' which freely adjoins 'Closed' to any 'Profunctor'.
* Added 'Tambara' which freely adjoins 'Strong' to any 'Profunctor'.
* Added 'Cotambara' which freely adjoins 'Choice' to any 'Profunctor'.
* Under the new 'Procompose' the old 'Rift' is now 'Ran', and the old 'Lift' was misnamed. It is now 'Rift'

4.0.3
-----
* Added `Data.Profunctor.Lift` containing the left Kan lift of a profunctor.

4.0.2
-----
* Added `assoc` to `Data.Profunctor.Composition` so that we have all 3 associators.

4.0
---
* Merged the contents of `profunctor-extras` into `profunctors`.

3.3
---
* Added `instance Choice (Upstar f)` and introduced `Forget`.

3.2
---
* Renamed `Lenticular` and `Prismatic` to `Strong` and `Choice`, and restructured them.

3.1.3
-----
* Removed upper bounds on my own intra-package dependencies

3.1.1
-----
* Added Documentation!
* Added `Lenticular` and `Prismatic` Profunctors

3.1
---
* instance Profunctor Tagged

3.0
---
* Updated version number to match the rest of my libraries
